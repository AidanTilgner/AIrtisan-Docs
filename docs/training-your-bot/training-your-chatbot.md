# Training your Bot

Now that you've created a bot, and you understand intents, we can get into training your bot specifically.

## Starting your Bot
![Test Bot Overview](@site/static/img/app-views/test-bot-overview.png)

As you can see here, "Test Bot" is not running by default. In order to get your bot up and running, you'll want to press the "Start Bot" button. This will start your bot, and you should see something like:

Which means that your bot is now running as expected, and you can get training!

## The Training Tab
First, click the "Training" tab on the sidebar. This will take you to the training page, which looks like this:

As you can see, you have a couple of things here:

- The name of the conversation, or "New Conversation" if it's a new conversation.
- A button to start a new conversation.
- A preview of the chats in the conversation so far
- A text box to input your message

Start by typing "Hello" into the text box, and pressing enter. You should see something like this by default:
