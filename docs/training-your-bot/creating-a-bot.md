# Creating a Bot

Creating a chatbot with AIrtisan is a simple and straightforward process. In this section, we'll walk you through the steps to create a chatbot that can respond to user messages. Before we get started, make sure you're [logged in](https://airtisan.app/login) to your AIrtisan account. Once you've logged in, you should be automatically redirected to the dashboard, if not [click here](https://airtisan.app) to go there now.

## Dashboard
Now that you're logged in, you should see a dashboard that looks like this:

As you can see, we have no bots yet. So to get started with a new one, click on the "New Bot" button. This should take you to the bot creation page:

On this page you'll see a form that allows you to create a new bot. Let's go through each of the fields:

- **Owner Type**: Is the owner going to be an organization, or you? For now just select "Me".
- **Name**: The name of your bot.
- **Description**: A short description of your bot.
- **Bot Version**: The version of your bot. This is used to track changes to your bot over time.
- **Bot Language**: The language of your bot. This is used to determine the language model that your bot will use.

Once you've inputted all of these fields, click "Create", and you should be taken to a page that looks like this:

Congratulations! You've created a chatbot! This, is your bot's overview. As you can see, there are a few buttons here which allow you to perform some actions, as well as some different information previews. If you take a look at the sidebar, you'll also see a couple of different options. In order to understand what they do however, you'll need to move on to the next section.
