# What is a Bot?
Let's talk about what a bot actually is and how they work.

## AIrtisan Chatbots
In the context of AIrtisan, a "bot" refers to a chatbot. That is, a standalone agent, which has its own training data, configuration, and responses. Essentially, think of it like a little AI that you can talk to. Now if you're heard of a chatbot before (which you probably have), then you probably already knew that. But what you might not know is how they work.

## How do they work?
In AIrtisan, bots work by using a machine learning technique called [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) (NLP). NLP is a branch of machine learning that deals with the processing of human language. It's what allows bots to understand what you're saying, and respond accordingly. More specifically, they work using a technique called [intent classification](/docs/basics/understanding-intents), which we'll talk more about later.

Essentially, when a bot receives a message, it uses intent classification to determine what the user is trying to say. Then, it uses that information to pick a predefined response, which it sends back to the user. This process allows a computer program to mimic human conversation, and is the basis for most chatbots.

## What's special about AIrtisan Bots?
It's no secret that intent classification and NLP more broadly are not new technologies. In fact, they've been used in combination with other techniques to create chatbots for many years now. However, the difference with AIrtisan chatbots comes down to ease of training, and the natural conversation produced by them.

### Ease of Training
By utilizing AI technologies, we've built a system that allows users to easily train new chatbots. Features such as Context Autogeneration, which allows users to type in their website, and automatically feed training data about that website to their chatbot. As well as other features both deployed and in the works. AIrtisan chatbots are easy to train, easy to deploy, and easy to use.

### Natural Conversation
The way that AIrtisan chatbots generate responses is also special, and allows them to create more natural conversations than traditional chatbots. Essentially, AIrtisan leverages a process we like to call "[response enhancement](/docs/basics/understanding-enhancement)", which allows users to define specific responses for certain messages, while still maintaining a natural conversational flow. This approach means that you can either train your chatbot's every response, and configure it to only use those responses, or you can allow it to be a little more free with its responses, and possibly sound more natural in the process.

## What's Next?
Now that you understand a bit about bots and how they work, you'll be interested in creating one. First, maybe take a peak at [this video](https://youtu.be/LrlozFJZo5I), which explains the bot creation process as of 1.0.0alpha. Then, go to the next page to learn about [intents](/docs/basics/understanding-intents), which are the basis for all AIrtisan bots.
